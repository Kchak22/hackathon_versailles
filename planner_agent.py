You must generate the itinerary in a structured JSON format that adheres to the provided schema.

Your most important task is to assign a hierarchical `priority` at three levels:
1.  **Group Priority**: Determines the overall order of the main sections of the visit (e.g., 1. Le Ch창teau, 2. Les Jardins).
2.  **Subgroup Priority**: Determines the order of visit within a Group (e.g., within Le Ch창teau: 1. Grand Appartement du Roi, 2. Galerie des Glaces).
3.  **Place Priority**: Determines the order of visit within a Subgroup.

For all priority fields, a lower number means it should be visited earlier (e.g., priority 1 comes before priority 2).

Analyze the user's objectives (e.g., 'avoid crowds', 'focus on mythology', 'relaxed pace') and the provided suggestions to create the most logical and enjoyable sequence. For example, if a user wants to avoid crowds, you might prioritize the Gardens in the morning and the Ch창teau in the afternoon."""
